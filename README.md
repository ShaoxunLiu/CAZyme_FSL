Workflow Code for "Novel Few-shots Learning Neural Network for Predicting Carbohydrate-active Enzyme (CAZyme) Affinity Towards Fructo-oligosaccharides".

Main operation code is in summary.R with all necessary processed prerequisite data in data file. Supplimentary code for prerequisite data generation are in other .R files.

Download and unzip data files to the working directory should work for the R codes. Modifications can be made to alter parameters.
